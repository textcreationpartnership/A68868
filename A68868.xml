            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The third is the Phyſicall Atheiſt, who meaſures all things by the law of nature. The laſt is the ſtupide or blockiſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſort of Atheiſt denying God altogether, are directly oppoſite to the Chriſtian, and in part onely to the Phyſicall Atheiſt. The Phyſicall Atheiſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting Atheiſt, are <hi>ſemiantipodes,</hi> halfe oppoſite: but the Chriſtian is directly oppoſite to him, and they are very antipodes.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Atheiſt is the diſputing Atheiſt, or ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, he propones whether there be a God or not, and while he hanges in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> betweene the two, yet he inclines more to the negative than to the affirmative part; and him we call <hi>dubitabundum Atheum,</hi> the doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Atheiſt, and he is in the middeſt as it were betwixt the contradicting Atheiſt, and the Phyſicall Atheiſt.</p>

And the common ſaying may be applied well to him, <hi>Where there is three Phyſitians there are two Atheiſts.</hi> And as thoſe who are borne in the bordering Country, ye can hardly diſcerne by their language what country men they are. So it is hard to tell whether this Phyſicall Atheiſt comes

                  <p>The fourth is the ſtupid Atheiſt, who by ſtupidity and blockiſhneſſe quenches that light of nature, which is inbred in all men.

And in this ſenſe the foole wiſhes in his heart that there were not a God to puniſh him, and to take order with him for his offences. Thirdly, the heart is taken for the conſcience, <hi>Davids</hi> heart is ſaid to ſmite him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. that is, his conſcience ſmote him.

                  <p>They binde themſelves by a promiſe: A promiſe is <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatio fidei,</hi> and here they paune their fidelitie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, but in an oath, there is <hi>obligatio animae &amp; ſalutis,</hi> In it they paund their fidelitie, honeſty, and ſoule, and then by covenant which is confirmed by write, by oath, and by ſome ſolemne rites, as when they confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their covenants of old, they vſed to divide a beaſt in two: and thoſe who entred into the covenant uſed to paſſe betwixt the parts of the beaſt divided, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Ier.</hi> 34.18. and they wiſhed, that if they brake that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; they might be parted and cutte as that beaſt was into peices: And the Hebrewes ſay, <hi>ſcindere faedus; David</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſciſſores faederis mei, Pſal.</hi> 50.5. that is, <hi>who made a covenant with me</hi> becauſe a beaſt was cut, when the covenant was made; and this covenant they called <hi>Berith.</hi> To promiſe to the devill is a great ſinne, but to binde our ſelves by an oath to him is a greater ſinne; but to enter in covenant, with him is the greateſt ſinne of all, to deliver up to him ſoule and body to be tormented and cut by him at his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in all covenants fidelitie is moſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected: There are foure great liars with whom a man
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20177:26"/> muſt not covenant, hell, death, the world, and the devill.</p>

                  <p>The deceitfull heart of man promiſeth to the ſecure ſinner immunitie from both theſe, and makes an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary covenant with man, and promiſeth to ſecure him from them both; firſt, that hee ſhall be free from hell, and promiſeth to him peace, when his deſtruction is at hand: when a man makes this kinde of covenant with his deceitfull heart, hee makes lies for his refuge, and his covenant is nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee is afraid of death the Iayler, and in comes the deceitfull heart of man, and makes this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie covenant, and puts the evill day farre from him, and ſo he makes lies his refuge. <hi>Hagag</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32. when he flattered himſelfe that the bitterneſſe of death was paſt, when as <hi>Samuels</hi> ſword was hanging over his head. Secure ſinners when death is neare to them, they put it farre from them, both in reſpect of preparation and expectation, and upon a ſudden it ſurpriſes them, and in a ſudden they goe downe to hell, wherefore we ſhould never covenant with them.</p>
                  <p>The third lier that we ſhould not covenant with is the world: The world is like that Olive tree, which <hi>Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacuck</hi> ſpeakes of, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17. <hi>mentita eſt oliva; the Olive tree made a lie.</hi> It promiſed faire in the ſpring when it bloſſomed, but it brought nothing to perfection.

                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">It is not lawful to make a covenant of peace with the devill, where God hath proclaimed warre.</note> God hath put an enmitie betwixt the ſeede of the woman and the ſeede of the Serpent; he hath not put anger betwixt them, for thoſe who are angry one with another, they may be reconciled again, but he hath put this enmitie and deadly hatred betwixt them therefore they ſhould never be reconciled.

The heat of the Prophets bodie here might have ſeemed to have had ſome naturall cauſe to have made the childs fleſh warme, and to have brought life to him againe; but there was no naturall cauſe here to helpe the child to live, but onely the power of God. So when the Lord commanded to lay a lumpe of figges to <hi>Ezekias</hi> his ſore, <hi>Eſay</hi> 38. Figges of themſelves would matured the boyle: One would have thought that there were ſome naturall power in the midſe here to produce this effect to make the boyle ripe, but there was no force at all in the midſe here when it was applied to the ſore, but the hand of the Lord did it onely.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> God uſed ſuch meanes to obſcure his power a little in working of the miracle, he caſt a vaile over his miracle covering it as it were with nature, and by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample taught us, that we ſhould not neglect the ſecond cauſes and ordinary meanes.<note place="margin">Why God uſeth meanes which hath no power in them, nor ſeemes to have no power.</note> Therefore Chriſt having wrought the miracle of the loaves, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the broken meat, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.8.

To make the bitter waters ſweet, was a miracle, but to make them ſweet by ſalt, that was a miracle within a miracle; So <hi>Num.</hi> 17. <hi>Aarons</hi> rod brought forth firſt leaves, and then it bloſſomed, to bring forth leaves was a miracle, but then to bloſſome was a miracle within a miracle: for all ſtonefruites bloſſomes firſt, and then brings forth leaves. So to reſtore the ſight to the blinde was a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. but to cure him by puting clay to his eyes, this was a miracle within a miracle. So 1 <hi>King</hi> 18.35. to ſend a fire from the heaven to burne the burnt offering was a miracle, but that the burnt offering ſhould burne when water was powred upon it, and the ditch round about the altar powred full of water, then for the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to burne, that was a miracle within a miracle; when the ſorcerer or witch uſeth ſuch meanes in which there is no power to heale, this is Magicke, and an uſurpation of Gods prerogative. Therefore the Hebrewes ſaith, <hi>In quocunque eſt aliquid de medicina in eo nihil eſt de via Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreorum, Lev.</hi> 18.3. That there is no witchcraft where we ſee naturall reaſon or phyſicke to appeare; when witches uſeth meanes to cure, which hath no naturall helpe in them; this is magicke uſurping one of Gods priviledges.</p>
                  <p>God uſeth ſometime one meanes to produce contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie effects;<note place="margin">Gods eight priviledge when hee uſeth one meanes to procure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects.</note> as the bitter waters made the guiltie wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans bellie to rot and conſume, but it made the honeſt woman to conceive, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.28.

This queſtion is diſputed by the Caſuiſts ſundry wayes. Some holds that they may uſe the helpe of a witch to remove the ſigne. If it be lawfull for one (ſay they) to borrow money of an uſurer if he be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lend it; and if it be lawfull to take an oath of him who ſweares by his Idols, why may we not, ſay they, uſe the helpe of a witch to remove the ſigne?</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> Hee who removes the ſigne that the devill may hurt no more, medles he not here with the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which the devill made with the witch, which was this: So long as the ſigne lies here it ſhall have power to hurt, but when it is removed, it ſhall have no power at all to hurt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although hee that removes the ſigne ſhould know that the covenant was thus made betwixt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and the witch, yet it would not follow that hee conſented to this covenant, for he deſires not the devill here to keepe his promiſe, when he removes the ſigne, neither enters he in a new covenant with the devill here, but by that means he breakes the covenant which the devill and the witch made, and takes away occaſion to call upon the devill hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But when hee removes the ſigne, and hopes that Satan ſhall not hurt hereafter, either he expects this event from a naturall cauſe, or from the will of man, or from God by a miracle; but he expects none of theſe wayes; therefore he lookes to have the event from the devill; and it is all one as if he ſhould ſay to the devill; thou promiſedſt ſo ſoone as this ſigne was removed to ceaſe to hurt any more, I remove the ſigne, therefore performe thou that which thou haſt promiſed?</p>

Therefore when he expects that the devil ſhould hurt no more, he doth not: as if he ſhould ſay, performe thou that which thou promiſed, ſeeing I have plaid my part, but rather thus, I breake off the covenant which thou madeſt with the witch, and hath removed this ſigne which thou appointedſt for hurt, therefore thou muſt hurt no more.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There may be three reaſons given of this;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20177:50"/> firſt, for his owne glory, hee did this to ſhew that his providence did reach as well to the higheſt as to the loweſt, not onely in the Church but alſo without the Church. And this was the reaſon why he ſent his Prophets ſometimes even to the heathen, as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> to Babylon, and <hi>Ionah</hi> to Nineveh, and all to ſhew them that all their good came from him if they feared him, but if they did not, then they ſhould feele his puniſhing hand. Secondly, the Lord did this both for their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and eternall good; for the Lord delights in the converſion of ſinners; wherefore hee doth not onely make his Sunne to ſhine upon the good and upon the bad, and calls them that wayes to repentance, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes by his word and by dreames, and his other benefites he invited them to repentance. And thirdly, he revealed himſelfe thus to the heathen for the good of his Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.14. <hi>He reproved kings for their ſake.</hi> And thus he revealed himſelfe in a dreame to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and to <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> for the Churches good. So <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.30. <hi>But as for me this ſecret is not revealed to me for any wiſedome that I have more than any living, but for their ſake that ſhall make the interpretation knowne to the King;</hi> that is, both for the Iewes and the whole Churches cauſe, who by their prayers obtained from the Lord to me the interpretation of this dreame; ſo that the dreame and the interpretation of the dreame were both given for the Churches cauſe. So he revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelfe to <hi>Pilats</hi> wife in a dreame for Chriſts cauſe. So the Lord ſent a Prophet to wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> promiſing him victory againſt the Aramites for the comfort of his Church: So <hi>Eliſha</hi> prophecied to <hi>Iehoram</hi> for <hi>Ioſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phats</hi> ſake, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.14.</p>

Secondly, ſome dreames are both from the ſpirit, and with the ſpirit; as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> dreame. Thirdly, ſome dreames are with the ſpirit, but not from the ſpirit; As a common dreame of the child of God, comes not from the ſpirit of God, but from the complection of his body or from the multitude of buſineſſes, and yet it may be with the ſpirit of ſanctification.

Neither muſt we take them to be from God, becauſe the mind is more ſetled after the dreame, then before. For Satan can transforme himſelfe into an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light. But the dreames which are from God, have ſome markes to diſcerne them, if ſo be that they are from him, for there is ſome internall inſtinct, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are ſtirred up to enquire what theſe dreames meane; as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did; and it is the part of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, to pray earneſtly to the Lord, to reveale to them, thoſe things which hath beene ſhowne to them in a dreame, for God openeth the eares of men in a dreame, and ſealeth their inſtruction, that hee might withdraw man from his purpoſe, and hide pride from man, <hi>Iob</hi> 33.15. God giveth warning to his children, ſomtimes of thoſe things which are to befal them. Such was that dreame, which <hi>Theodoſius</hi> dreamed, that the Biſhop ſet a Crowne upon his head; when as he never

And thirdly, it is a fearefull thing to meddle with things devoted or anathematized, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wittingly as <hi>Achan</hi> did, or ignorantly as <hi>Ionathan</hi> did. Secondly, conſultorie lots ſerved to decide who were fitteſt for callings in the Church, as when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> called <hi>Barſabas</hi> and <hi>Mathias</hi> ſtood for the Apoſtleſhip.

But onely to ſhew that he would uſe the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes which were appointed for the Altar, when he tooke the coale from it: So the Angell when hee appeared in a bodie to <hi>Manoah</hi> he went up in the fire, but was not burnt by it, <hi>Iudge</hi> 13.20.</p>
                  <p>No externall thing can affect the devill, as we are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſuch: beauty affects not his ſight; muſicke affects not his hearing; nor odours his ſmell, for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpirit, nothing affects him but ſimilitude of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Therefore that is fabulous which is ſet downe in <hi>Tobit</hi> 6.14. That the devill was in love with <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ah</hi> for her beauty; he loved her not for the gifts of her mind, for then he ſhould have loved them beſt who exceede moſt in graces; but he hated Chriſt above all others: Therefore he doth not love any for the graces of their minde, but hates them more: when the devill beholds the goodneſſe of the creatures, as their beauty, comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, honeſty, &amp;c. although in the generall hee ſee them to be good; yet he is ſo carried with his habituall malice, that he cannot like the good that is in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; And even as theſe wretches, who make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves away, have a generall liking of their life by the very inſtinct of nature; yet through griefe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire they put often hands on themſelves: ſo the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall malice of the devils ſuffers them not to like any good that is in the creature.<note place="margin">The counterfeit wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in the Chriſtian Church.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the Chriſtian Church uſeth falſe meanes to expell the devils, as the Church of Rome uſeth ſalt, ſpittle, holy water, and conſecrate oyle; the primitive Church firſt uſed this oyle in working of miracles, then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers afterward uſed it by imitation; and laſt the Papiſts uſe it as <hi>viaticum</hi> to further them to heaven.</p>
                  <p>So they uſe exorciſing of devils, Chriſt himſelfe caſt out devils by the power of the ſpirit, and ſo he left this power of exorciſing for a while in the Church, for the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20177:93"/> eſtabliſhing of the Goſpell when it was new planted; he doth otherwayes <hi>in conſtituenda eccleſia,</hi> than hee doth <hi>in constituta eccleſia:</hi> And even as a Gardiner when he removes a tree out of one ground to another, he ſets ſo many ſtayes to it to hold it up, and he powres water againſt the roote of it daily, but when it hath once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken roote, hee pulls away the ſtayes from it, and leaves it to the ordinary courſe of growing, as other trees; So the Lord beſtoweth at the firſt in the infancie of the Church theſe miracles, as ſtayes to confirme, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the Primitive Church theſe gifts laſted for a while; but now to uſe this exorciſing in the Church, is to uſe that which is out of date, and it is now but a carnall weapon which Satan cares not for; <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were two precious ſtones ſet in the breaſt plate of <hi>Aaron,</hi> by the which hee anſwered the people when hee asked him of matters doubtfull; theſe two ſtones were not in the ſecond temple; now if the prieſt ſhould have put in two counterfeit ſtones in the breaſt plate, and had given his anſwers to the people By them (when as the Lord anſwered not by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>) would he not have beene holden for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver? So he who profeſſes himſelfe now to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſt, when as the gift ceaſeth in the Church now, hee is to be accounted an impoſter and deceiver.</p>
                  <p>There were three ſorts of gifts beſtowed upon the Church; ſome ſimply neceſſary, as the Word and Sacraments: ſome were neceſſary for her <hi>in ſtatu legali,</hi> when ſhe was under the rudiments of the Law, which

                  </p>
                  <p>The true meanes to reſiſt Satan, are; firſt, the ſhield of faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Above all taking the ſhield of faith, whereby ye ſhall be able to quench all the fierie darts of the wicked;</hi> where the Apoſtle alludes to the cuſtome of old, for when they dipped the heads of their arrowes in poyſon, and ſhot them at their enemies, they fired their fleſh: So Satans tentations are fiery darts, and the ſhield of faith is ſaid to quench them.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt takes the defence of his diſciples here, becauſe it was not time for them to faſt, ſo long as the bridegroome was with them; but elſewhere he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them for not faſting.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> prayed thrice againſt the temptations of Satan, and Chriſt blamed his diſciples becauſe they had not joyned faſting and prayer together to caſt out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; and where it is ſaid, that the Phariſees and <hi>Iohns</hi> diſciples faſted, but not Chriſts diſciples; the meaning is, they faſted not uſually as <hi>Iohns</hi> diſciples and the Phariſees did, but yet they faſted.</p>
                  <p>The third weapon to beate the devill, is the ſword of the ſpirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. take the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.8.

                  <p>This ſword divides betwixt the ſoule and the ſpirit; but the Magiſtrates ſword divides onely the head from the body.</p>
                  <p>This ſword is of greateſt force againſt the devils ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; It was by this ſword that Chriſt beat Satan and all his tentations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. when the diſciples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe from the preaching of the Goſpel, then Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.18. <hi>I ſaw Satan fall as lightning from heaven:</hi> the preaching of the Goſpel is the ſpeciall meane to make Satan fall; when <hi>David</hi> gat the ſword of <hi>Goliah</hi> in his hand, having experience of it, before he ſaid, <hi>there is no ſword like that,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.10. ſo there is no ſword like this ſword in the ſpirituall combate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the devill.</p>

                        <hi>3</hi> Contra fundamentum.</note> Thirdly, there are errors, <hi>contra fundamentum,</hi> and raſeth the foundation, for theſe a man ſhold not leave a Church, if the Church be not wholly infected with them &amp; totally. There were amongſt the <hi>Galathians</hi> ſome who maintained the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Iuſtification by works, but becauſe all maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it not, therefore they were not to leave the Church for that error. So in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> there were who maintained, that there was no reſurrection from the dead, but becauſe this was not holden by all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20177:107"/> the Church was not to be left for this. So there were in the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> who held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> yet all held it not; therefore the Church was not to be left for that: The whole head may be ſicke, and the whole heart faint, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.5. and yet may recover againe; as the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> was ready to die, yet the Lord exhorts her to repent, and to watch, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.3. and to ſtrengthen the things which remaine, that are ready to die; but when once ſhee is dead, and no life to be found in her, then men are to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves from her. Hence it was that the Prieſts and Levites in this caſe, left Iſrael and came to Iudah, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. becauſe ſhee was a dead Church, and not a decaying: Therefore the Lords ſoule hath no delight in thoſe who ſeparate themſelves from the Church, and make a rent, finding but ſmall blemiſh in her.</p>

When a Prince doth againſt Iuſtice who ſhould maintaine Iuſtice, there is a ſpeciall repugnancie betwixt his act and his calling: So when <hi>Aaron</hi> to whom was concredit the puritie of Gods worſhip, committed Idolatrie, then there was a ſpeciall repugnancie betwixt him and his profeſſion: how ſcandalous then was <hi>Aarons</hi> fall to the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>In exemplum culpa vehementer extenditur, quando pro reverentia peccator honoratur,</hi> The fault is much agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the example, when the ſinner is much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and honored.<note place="margin">The greatneſſe of <hi>Aarons</hi> ſinne may be taken up by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſacrifice of the high Prieſt which was to expiate the ſin.</note>

Thirdly the Scripture ſometimes ſets downe the greater number and leaves out the leſſer <hi>ob rotundatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> numeri</hi> as <hi>Iudg.</hi> 20.46. all thoſe that fel that day of <hi>Benjamin</hi> were 25 thouſand, the whole number that fell were 25 thouſand, and one hundred, but when the Scripture ſums them up, it ſets downe the greater number and leaves out the hundreth: ſo 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.4. <hi>David</hi> raigned 40 yeares; he raigned 40 yeares and ſixe moneths, but to make the number round, the 6 moneths are left out. Fourthly when the thing numbred comes farre ſhort of the number, then the Scripture draweth it not that <hi>aed rotundationem numeri,</hi> but acknowledgeth
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20177:116"/> it in effect to be nothing, becauſe it hath bin ſo ſeldome done: as ye ſacrificed not unto me 40 yeares in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, becauſe they ſacrificed ſo ſeldome unto him in the wildernes, therfore the Scripture ſaith, ye ſacrificed not to me in the wildernes. Some reckons this time that they ſacrificed not in the wilderneſſe, to be from the time that the ſpyes returned from the ſearching of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and all that time they ſacrificed not: as <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Ribera</hi> upon <hi>Amos</hi> affirme.</p>
                  <p>The third thing to bee inquired here is this: what theſe Idols were which they worſhipped in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>Amos</hi> 5.26. <hi>But ye have borne the Tabernacle of your Moloch and Chium your images, the ſtarre of your god which you made to your ſelves,</hi> ver. 27. <hi>Therefore I will cauſe you to goe into captivity beyond Damaſcus ſaith the Lord.</hi> But <hi>Acts</hi> 7.42. <hi>Yea ye tooke up the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the ſtar of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worſhip them, and I will carry you beyond Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt it is to be conſidered, that the Lord gave them up to worſhip the Hoſte of heaven. Secondly, what they worſhipped. Thirdly, the puniſhment, they ſhall be carried beyond <hi>Babylon</hi> for their Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Firſt the Lord gave them up to worſhip the Hoſte of heaven, that is, as they turned to the Idolatry of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſo the Lord turned to give them up to ſerve the Hoſte of heaven.<note place="margin">Their Idolatry.</note>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:20177:122"/> elders who out lived <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and who were in age, when they came out of Egypt, and remembred what the Lord had done for Iſrael; the iniquitie of <hi>Baalpeor</hi> did not cleave unto them, but the reſt were not cleanſed from the iniquitie of <hi>Baalpeor, Ioſh.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Is the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Baalpeor to little for us from which we are not clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto this day:</hi> they committed no new Idolatrie, but the filthineſſe of <hi>Baalpeor</hi> clave unto them, becauſe they repented not of that iniquitie. In every ſinne there are foure things to be conſidered; firſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, the tranſgreſſion of the Law: ſecondly, <hi>reatus,</hi> the guilt which obligeth the partie who ſinneth to undergoe the puniſhment. Thirdly, <hi>macula,</hi> the blot which defileth the ſoule; and laſtly, the puniſhment it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the tranſgreſſion of the Law; and the conſequents of the tranſgreſſion are the guilt, the blot, and the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>The guilt of ſinne bindes a man to anſwer for the tranſgreſſion of the Law, and it ſtands in the middeſt betwixt the ſinne and the puniſhment, and goeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the puniſhment, and it is more terrible than the puniſhment:<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>4.</hi> de divinis nomi nibus part. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> Therefore <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſaid well, <hi>non eſt malum puniri, ſed fieri poena dignum,</hi> that is, it is not evill to be puniſhed, but to deſerve puniſhment; yet wretched ſinners are affraid of the puniſhment, but not of the guilt; but the martyres of God choſe rather to indure the greateſt torments, then to incurre the guilt of ſinne. If we would eſcape the puniſhment, we muſt firſt looke that the guilt be removed. Manie thinke when the ſinne is paſt and forgotten in their mindes, then there is no more puniſhment to follow, but if the guilt lie ſtill unpardoned, the ſinne remaineth ſtill: <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethrens ſinne lay over twenty yeares, and this ſinne which they committed at <hi>Baalpeor</hi> lay over a long time unrepented of, but as long as the guilt remained, ſo
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:20177:122"/> long were they ſubject to puniſhment; the puniſhment alwaies followeth the guilt, as the ſhadow doth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

                  <p>The third thing conſiderable in ſinne is the blot or ſtaine of ſinne in the ſoule. This ſtaine blots the ſoule, as Inke caſt upon a Laune cloath defileth it; and even as in bodily things, ſpots taketh away that nitor and brightneſſe which is in the body, ſo doth ſinne deprive the ſoule of grace, and makes it deformed; <hi>Saul</hi> was as comely and proper a man as was in all <hi>Iſrael</hi> and he was <hi>Tobh bonus id eſt pulcher,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tobh</note> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.2. Yet this blot of ſinne ſo defiled him, that he was no more the ſonne of <hi>Kiſh</hi> the <hi>Benjamite,</hi>

When the Tabernacle was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, or ſet downe, no ſtranger might come neare it; here all are called ſtrangers, who are not prieſts or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, <hi>Num.</hi> 1.51. But when they were to ſacrifice, no ſtranger might ſacrifice, that is, neither Iſraelite, nor Levite, <hi>Num.</hi> 3.10. Therfore when he choſe a Levite to ſacrifice, here there was a great irregularitie: their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings were two diſtinct callings:<note place="margin">The calling of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites and the prieſts were two diſtinct cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</note> the Levites did ſome things which the prieſts might not doe, as to carry the Arke: therefore <hi>Vzza</hi> was killed who touched the Arke being a prieſt; and the Levites might not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice under the paine of death, <hi>Num.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p>This wandering Levite was redacted to great miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and he was content with a poore portion: It was a great curſe upon the poſterity of <hi>Eli,</hi> when they ſhould come and crouch for a peece of ſilver, and a morſell of bread, and ſhould ſay, <hi>Put me I pray thee into one of the prieſts offices, that I may eate a peece of bread,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.36. So when this baſe Levite ſought to be a prieſt, and was content with ten ſhekells of ſilver a yeare, and a ſuite of apparell, and his victuals, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17.10. then he came and crouched downe for a peece of ſilver and a morſell of bread.</p>
                  <p>None that ſerved in the temple or tabernacle in the baſeſt office did it for nought, as they that ſhut the doores, and kindled the fire, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.10. or the <hi>Nethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims, Ioſh.</hi> 9.27. who hewed the wood for the ſacrifices, and drew water for the temple, or the Levites that flead the beaſts, or the Prieſts that offered the ſacrifices; all had plenty enough, there was bread enough in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe: but this miſerable man contents himſelfe in his Idoll ſervice, with a ſute of apparell, his victualls, and tenne peeces of ſilver.</p>

                  <p>Hee deſires to be a prieſt that he might eate bread, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.26. When they deſired to be in this holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling onely to eate, and not to ſerve God in it, then they were mercenaries. The Moraliſts obſerve, that ſome games and recreations are honeſt, when men uſe them onely for recreation, as to fiſh, and to hunt; but if a man doe fiſh onely for gaine, or goe a hunting onely to make profit by it, then it becomes ignoble, <hi>&amp; queſtus eſt ſordidus,</hi> it is baſe gaine: much more if a man turne this high calling to gaine, it becomes a baſe calling: When theſe greedy dogges, <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.11. cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; and when they ſeeke the peoples goods, but not themſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. and fleece the flocke, but feede it not; <hi>Ezech.</hi> 34.3. <hi>tunc mercantur animas,</hi> they ſell the foules of men, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. <hi>and ſell the ſoules of the people for handfulls of barley, and peeces of bread, Ezech.</hi> 13.19. then they feed the flocke for filthy lucre, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.</p>

The Iewes who live here in Europe, when they are in their ſynagogues, they never uncover their heads, which is altogether contrary to the cuſtome of Europe: They ſalute great men here uncovering their heads, and ſo ſhould they pray according to the canon of <hi>Maimonides;</hi> but

                  <p>The laſt reaſon to prove that the <hi>Meſſsias</hi> is come, is this, No Iew at this day can tell what genealogie hee is of; They have loſt all their genealogies, which they kept all the tyme of their firſt captivity, and after they returned home againe as wee may ſee in <hi>Eſdras</hi> 2. they that could not ſhew their genealogies were debarred from any charge; Theſe genealogies they kept, that they might know of what tribe the Lord was to come, and ſo they kept their marriages of the heretrixes only to marie within their owne tribe, to know of what tribe Ieſus Chriſt was to come; and ſo they kept ſtill their fathers poſſeſſions, that the tribes might not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, but all thoſe are confounded amongſt them now, therefore the <hi>Meſsias</hi> is come already.</p>
                  <p>A Chriſtian may demand of a Iew why the Magitians came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eaſt at this time to worſhip Chriſt, &amp; why <hi>Herod</hi> was ſo deſirous to know the place of the birth of Chriſt, and cauſed the infants to be killed, and ſpared not his owne ſon (as <hi>Macrobius,</hi> witneſſeth who was a gentile Philoſopher) was it not the feare that Chriſt the King was borne, which moved him to doe that?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a chriſtian may demand what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (about that time eſpecially) that ſo many gave themſelves out for Chriſts, as that <hi>Egyptian</hi> who raiſed ſedition, and led out into the wilderneſſe foure thouſand men that were murtherers, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.38.

                  <p>Thirdly they may demand why the <hi>Iewes</hi> fell away from the <hi>Romans</hi> at that time; there was no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon indeede, but becauſe generally it was received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould come and deliver

The death of the croſſe is an untimely death, a violent death, a paenall death, and that in the higheſt degree. Paine, ſhame, and the curſe, are the three Iaylers that attend ſinne, and ſinners conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; and every one of thoſe is worſe then another; for ſhame is worſe than paine, and therefore many have made choiſe to ſuffer rather the paine than the ſhame, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.4. <hi>Saul</hi> deſired his armour bearer rather to thruſt him through, than the Philiſtimes ſhould come and mocke him, and then kill him, which would have beene a double death to him: So <hi>Abimelech</hi> willed his armour bearer to kill him, that men might not ſay that a woman had killed him, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9.54.
